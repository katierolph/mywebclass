				<p1>Maisy is my puppy. We got her in November 2016 at the All For Paws Rescue. While we do not 
					know what kind of dog she is, we do know that she is a mix of many types including boxer and 
					possibly even coonhound (because she has webbed feet). She is a very big dog. When I lay on the
					ground with her, she is just as tall as me! Believe it or not, she was very small when 
					we first got her.</p1>

<br />
				<p2>Some of Maisy's favorite past times include eating pillows (as shown in the picture), playing
					playing with ropes, snuggling, and running laps around the house! She is a very active
					puppy and <i>hates</i> being home alone in her crate all day because she can't spend time with
					the people she loves most!</p2>
				<p3>Maisy's absolute favorite thing to do is to talk with her friends. Often, they stay up late
					at night "texting" each other! Maisy's best friend is Bentley and they love to send each other
					pictures all the time!</p3>

				<p4>Bentley is an older dog than Maisy. Her owner, Joy, loves to play and snuggle with her too.
					Both Bentley and Maisy love going on walks, playing, and sleeping. They have many things in
					common and they talk about going on walks all the time! They are both very silly dogs who like
					to eat household objects as well as food. Bentley is one of Maisy's best friend.</p4>
