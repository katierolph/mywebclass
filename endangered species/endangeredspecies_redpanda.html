					<h2>Fast Facts</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>The number of Red Pandas left on the planet is estimated to be <b>less then</b>
								10,000.</li>
							<li>Red pandas share a gene with the more common black and white panda
								which allows them to grab bamboo. This gene helps them survive by making it easier 
								for them to get food to eat!</li>
							<li>Bamboo makes up about 90% of a red panda's diet! Other common foods they
								might find and eat in the wild include some fruits, nuts, and roots too.</li>
							<li>Although the Red Panda is part of the carnivorous order, it is actually not a
								carnivore, but rather an herbivore.</li>
							<li>The distinct color of the Red panda's fur allows it to camouflage well with 
								fir trees to hide from predators.</li>
							<li>Red pandas make a twittering noise that sounds similar to a bird.</li>

					<h2 id="stop">What is a Red Panda?</h2>
						<p>At first, red pandas were deemed a member of the raccoon family, Procyonidae.
							Yet, very recently they were given their own family. Red pandas are the only known 
							species in the Ailurus family. They can be easily spotted with their rusty 
							red color, round heads, and distinct pointy ears. Another prominent feature of the 
							red panda is the fuzzy tail, which is marked by red and bluff rings. The white 
							circles around their eyes and much of their face make it easier to see their features. 
							The red panda uses scent to mark locations and also is a very skilled climber.
							Red pandas are a distinct species with lots of special features.

					<h2 id="noborder">Conservation</h2>
						<p>Red pandas are classified as an endangered species and are protected in China, India, 
							Bhutan, Nepal, and many other countries. Research shows that the population of
							Red Pandas in the world has declined almost 50% in the last 20 years. It is very important
							to conserve the land and resources for these animals in order for their species
							to be conserved. Loss of habitat for Red Pandas generally results from logging and human
							encroaching. Also on the rise, poaching and illegal trade has caused the population of 
							Red Pandas to decline. Combined with changing climate and the possibility of natural disaster, 
							the threat for the extinction of Red Pandas is on the rise. The International Union for Conservation
							of Nature is working to conserve the habitat and food source for Red Pandas as well
							as making a constant effort to increase awareness.</p>
