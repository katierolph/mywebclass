				<figure>One of my favorite things is Broadway. I love going and spending the day in New York City. My
					favorite part is going to see a Broadway show in Times Square.</figure>

				<figure>I went on vacation two years ago during spring break to Myrtle Beach. There was not one moment
					where anyone was bored because there was so much to do. We could go to the beach, the poo, the
					boardwalk, and we could go explore the town. I hope to go again soon!</figure>

				<figure>My favorite activity is dance. I love all styles of dance and I study all of them. Out of the many, 
					one of my favorites is pointe. While the other styles are difficult and each has its own attributes,
					I love the hard work that goes into perfecting each step on pointe. I wear these types of
					pointe shoes many days a week.</figure>

				<figure>Disney World is also one of my top spots to vacation. I love each park and you could never be
					bored spending a week there. Disney is such a magical place, everyone wants to go to the
					<i>happiest place on earth.</i></figure>
